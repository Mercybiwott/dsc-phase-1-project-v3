# Phase 1 Project

## Project Overview

For this project, data cleaning, imputation, analysis, and visualization was done to generate insights for a business stakeholder.
### Introduction
This project is designed to carry out a research study on aircraft accidents and provide a detailed report on whichh aircraft is the safest as well as provide recommendation to abusiness owner who is venturing into the new business venture The project entailS ,Business Understanding, data undersanding, loading the data sets, data wrangling, data cleaning and data vizualizations.

#### Business Problem
A company embarks on the expansion into new industry to diversify its portfolio, a strategic decision has been made to venture into the aviation sector, specifically focusing on the acquisition and operation of airplanes for both commercial and private enterprise.However amidst this ambitious endavour, a critical knowledge gap has been identified: there is an absence of understanding regarding the potential risk associated with aircraft operation.

This project meticulously assesses and determines which aircraft present the lowest risk profile for the company to initiate the new business venture.The projects goal is to provide actionable insights in the head of the newly established aviation divion , enabling informed decion making regarding the selection and acquision of aircraft that align with the overaching business objectives while mitigating potential risk.

A detailed analysis of aircraft model, weather condition, number of engines and broad phase of flight has been done in attempt to cover the existing knowledge gap. The resulting insights will serve as the cornerstone for strategic planning and decision-making within the aviation division, guiding the selection and procurement of aircraft models that offer the optimal balance between risk mitigation and operational efficiency. Through diligent investigation and informed analysis, the study aims to empower the leadership of the aviation division with the necessary knowledge and insights to navigate this new venture successfully, ensuring that the expansion into the aviation industry is characterized by prudent risk management and sustainable growth.



#### Data Understanding

 The project utilzes a data set derived from kaggle which comprises aviation accident data sourced from the National Transportation Safety Board, covering incidents within civil aviation from 1962 to 2023, both within the United States and in international waters. The data contains over 90,000 rows and 31 columns.

However this project has utilized only 10 columns that is relevant in aswering the project object. The study puts heavy focus Manufacture based attributes such as the make and model, number of engines in an aircraft as well as other sitautional variables such as the broad phase of flight, the weather condition, injury severity and the total death count.[dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses)

### Data Visualization
#### Conclusions
# Key Findings
1. Aircrafts with one engine are involved in most accidesnts. Aircraft manufactures that make aircraft with one ingine risk human life, this is because in an spect of engine technicality, a subsequent accident is more prevalent
2. Most accidents occur during landing, take off and crusise respectively
3. Cessna Aircraft model report a higher level of accident incidents
   


### Recommendations
1. Regular Maintenance and inspection of aircrafts. This is critically essential for single engie aircaft to ensure appropriate workability standards and consequent protection of human lives.
2. Focus on safety procedures and trainings on critical phases of flight. Communicate safety procedures to passengers, as well as tran the cabin crue on first aid to affected individuals.
3. Invest on latest aircraft, with highest safety standards and technologies.
